What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The first struggle was in understanding what attributes were meant for which class. After that, it was difficult to define the function within the classes such that it was manipulating the computer class, as I could only figure out how to work it with numbers. I struggled with understanding how Python handles objects and lists. At first, I was confused about how to properly add and remove objects from a list, since I was accidentally trying to add objects to a list when they had already been added to the list. Once I figured out that I should define the BuyComputer function as adding the computer to the inventory, it flowed a lot easier. Another challenge was figuring out why my inventory was printing strange. It was first the issue that I was printing an object instead of a list of objects, but then the issue was that I was printing object locations, which I fixed by defining a short description in the computer class. My advice to someone else would be to map out the code before attempting, as it is easier to figure out what to do when you don't have to worry about all of the syntax.
